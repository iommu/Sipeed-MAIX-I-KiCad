# Sipeed M1/M1W KiCAD library
This is a simple library for the Sipeed M1(W) MAIX module 

# To install
Copy either the contents of, or the full folders of the footprints/symbols folder into a folder on your computer (for installing on a project by project basis I recommend this folder be inside your projects main folder)

In the KiCAD Schematic layout editor navigate to preferences > manage symbol libraries and under either the "Global" or "Project Specific Libraries" tab press the folder icon and nagiate to the Sipeed.lib file

In the KiCAD PCB layout editor navigate to preferences > manage footprint libaries and under either the "Global" or "Project Specific Libraries" tab press the folder icon and nagiate to the Sipeed.pretty folder

# Note
As of yet I have not tested this library so use at your own risk and please report any errors you find :)
